    """
    Optimize education path based on user preferences and available data.

    This function filters the available education paths based on the user's maximum cost preference, preferred field of study,
    and, if specified, the maximum duration of undergraduate studies. It then calculates a benefit-to-cost ratio for each 
    education path. The path with the highest benefit-to-cost ratio is selected as the optimal education path.

    Parameters:
    - preferences (dict): A dictionary containing user preferences, including maximum cost and field of study.
    - data (DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame containing education path data, including cost, field, and duration.
    - undergrad_duration (int, optional): The maximum duration (in years) for undergraduate studies. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
    - str: The name of the optimal education path based on the calculated benefit-to-cost ratio.
